# Moonbird blog posts

This repository contains blog posts for the moonbird.de website. Posts can be seen as reminders of how to do certain 
things, like setting up buildchains, redesigning web pages, using tools etc. 

If you stumble over any errors in the posts, please create an [issues entry](https://github.com/Moonbird-IT/blog/issues) and reference the post, so I can fix it.

If you are interested in learning more about a certain web topic, get in contact with me and I'll see if I can help.

Happy coding!
